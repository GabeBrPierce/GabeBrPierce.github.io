          <p>
            I, Gabriel Pierce, have the privilege to call myself by many titles.
            A father, a husband, a Christian, but most know me by my work title,
            a software developer. I have many skills, and know many languages,
            which can be seen on my RESUMELINK. But in school I majored in Web
            Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a passion for pleasing people. So, Client-Centric development
            is my go-to. And a proven Agile philosophy keeps transparency
            between me and my clients. I love it when I, a customer, and or a
            friend loves their product. My goal is to make solutions that not
            only solve a business problem, but also are pleasant to be around.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started developing software when I was 16, using scripting
            languages that would help me play video games. I didn’t actively
            pursue coding for a long while, not because of a lack of interest,
            but because I thought it was something that I could never do
            professionally, due to my lack of professional coding knowledge.
            Little did I know then, my goal wasn’t too far from what I was
            already doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flash forward 5 years, me and my wife found out that she was
            pregnant. At the time, I just stopped working as a mentor in the
            AmeriCorps program and picked up what I could as a google sheet
            developer. And I wasn’t making enough money to support a family of
            three. And so, it was obvious that a change was needed. And it
            needed to happen fast, so I attended the Ogden-Weber Technical
            College, in Ogden Utah. I chose this school because they offered
            self-paced coursework and had a wonderful job placement percentage.
          </p>
          <p>
            I flew through the courses, and learned as much as I could, and
            earned my degree at record breaking speed. And achieved a 4.0/4.0 on
            my GPA. But I was disappointed, as a lot of entry-level positions
            required a bachelor’s degree. And often wouldn’t even consider my
            application.

          <p>
            I got a lucky break, I got hired to work as a contractor at HILL
            AFB. Unfortunately, this wasn’t a software position like I would
            have hoped. But it was working with computers. I received a Secret
            Clearance. And I continue to find and grab great opportunities that
            work with data, and computer science.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know what you’re thinking, “So, you never have been hired as a
            software developer?”, and yes that is technically true. But, all
            this time, since I got out of school, I have been running my own
            business. I hired myself to satisfy clients and meet deadlines. So
            yes, no company has hired me (yet) to do software development. But I
            have been working as a software developer for [years, months, days].
          </p>
          <p>
            So don’t just take my word for it, here is a quote I have from one
            of my long running clients.
