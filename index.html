                <p>
                    I, Gabriel Pierce, have the privilege to call myself by many titles. A father, a husband, a
                    Christian, but most know me by my work title, a software developer. I have many skills, and know
                    many languages, which can be seen on my RESUMELINK. But in school I majored in Web Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a passion for pleasing people. So, Client-Centric development is my go-to. And a proven Agile
                    philosophy keeps transparency between me and my clients. I love it when I, a customer, and or a
                    friend loves their product. My goal is to make solutions that not only solve a business problem, but
                    also are pleasant to be around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started developing software when I was 16, using scripting languages that would help me play video
                    games. I didn’t actively pursue coding for a long while, not because of a lack of interest, but
                    because I thought it was something that I could never do professionally, due to my lack of
                    professional coding knowledge. Little did I know then, my goal wasn’t too far from what I was
                    already doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flash forward 5 years, me and my wife found out that she was pregnant. At the time, I just stopped
                    working as a mentor in the AmeriCorps program and picked up what I could as a google sheet
                    developer. And I wasn’t making enough money to support a family of three. And so, it was obvious
                    that a change was needed. And it needed to happen fast, so I attended the Ogden-Weber Technical
                    College, in Ogden Utah. I chose this school because they offered self-paced coursework and had a
                    wonderful job placement percentage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I flew through the courses, and learned as much as I could, and earned my degree at record breaking
                    speed. And achieved a 4.0/4.0 on my GPA. But I was disappointed, as a lot of entry-level positions
                    required a bachelor’s degree. And often wouldn’t even consider my application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I got a lucky break, I got hired to work as a contractor at HILL AFB. Unfortunately, this wasn’t a
                    software position like I would have hoped. But it was working with computers. I received a Secret
                    Clearance. And I continue to find and grab great opportunities that work with data, and computer
                    science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know what you’re thinking, “So, you never have been hired as a software developer?”, and yes that
                    is technically true. But, all this time, since I got out of school, I have been running my own
                    business. I hired myself to satisfy clients and meet deadlines. So yes, no company has hired me
                    (yet) to do software development. But I have been working as a software developer for [years,
                    months, days].
                </p>
                <p>
                    So don’t just take my word for it, here is a quote I have from one of my long running clients.
